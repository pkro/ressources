## Courses

#### [edx](https://udemy.com) 

Hit and miss, improving now with auto-graded coding exercises; don't take courses without challenge sections. Don't pay more than 12 euro, discounts are regular. Very helpful teaching assistants in the courses i took so far. Good forum section for each video. Huge amount of courses, and most courses have a huge amount of content for very little money.

#### [edx](https://edx.org) 

Very good, though not always practical university level courses

#### [Linkedin learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/)  

Treasure trove of small and larger courses (though rarely more than 5 hours); Good for a quick overview of a topic. Recommended course for a daily quick css fix: "css shorts"

Huge variety of topics, from self improvement, project management, graphics to springboot, react and assembler. Very hit and miss quality. No autograded exercises, so active learning is recommended here.


## Other

[tomato timer](https://tomato-timer.com/)

Pace yourself when learning or working. Set to > 25 minutes in settings.

## Lanugage learning

[Duolingo](https://duolingo.com)

Large amount of languages, gamified. A lot of fun. English as the base ("from") language has more and longer courses, but other common native lanugages have very good content, too.

[Spanishdict](https://www.spanishdict.com/)

Very good and addicting spanish vocabulary trainer with good and user defined lists. Often phrases have many possible translations with no indication (except when clicking on the word) which one to use.
